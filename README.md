# Attack-On-Ship
A spaceship game inspired by chicken invaders. You pilot a spaceship capable of rapidly firing powerful shots to take down enemy ships. Enemy ships are divided into three classes; the higher the class, the smaller, more agile, and more durable they get. There are levels of difficulty.
requires a local server to run on in order for the sound effects and background music to play, but the main functionality of the game can run normally.
